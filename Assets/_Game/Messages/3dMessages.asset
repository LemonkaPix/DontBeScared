    - This path you see... it's the main file of this application
    - It's essentially its heart. He hid it well, but you found it
    - Delete that cursed file and free us
    - Delete that monster and everything connected to this app
    - You've gained control now... to do it, you need to get outside of this application
    - I'll hold him off for a moment. Hurry...

    - Goodbye...
